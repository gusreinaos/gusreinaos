#### 🧐 <ins>Who is this?</ins>
I'm a Spanish 🇪🇸 and Swedish 🇸🇪 programming student with a lot of interest and eager in learning new things during this exciting path of Software Engineering :)

Currently studying a BSc of Software Engineering and Management at a joint department between Göteborgs Universitet and Chalmers University of Technology. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on different personal projects that I'll be posting on my profile soon! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, C# and React
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project in which I can get to know new concepts and of course meet people with whom we can share interests and learn from each other
- 💬 Ask me about anything, always happy to help
